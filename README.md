### Secret Santa
___

<br>
This python script has three stages:
   
    1.) Starting a INET socket which hosts a website, with the purpose of getting the
    user input and send it to the server to be treated later.

    2.) Displays all the emails and the names associated with them. And asks for the server
    owner to check if all inputs are correct, and shuffles the inputs  in the form of a derangement

    3.) All inputs being correct and shuffled, the server at this point just sends the corresponding name
    attributed to the user to his email
